# xml2json
A simple library to convert arbitrary xml to json

I wrote this program to solve a problem that I faced while trying to
pump in xml documents into Elasticsearch. This is not complete - as
in, it does not handle tag attributes.

I've written this in nim since it's the best programming language -
here's proof

;)

And since this written in nim, it will work on Windows/Linux/Mac and
any other platform for which you have a C compiler. I'd be more than
glad to help you out!
